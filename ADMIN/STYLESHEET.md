# STYLESHEET

UPDATED: 2022/03/26
For purposes of clear communication and readable code:

1. Constants ALLCAPS, like any sane person would do
2. Variable-names in snake_case, descriptiveness is appreciated
3. Comment what variable represents //VSC shows annotation of variable on mouseover over any appearance of that variable

4.

Further points

- Make as much of the code immutable as possible, will help reduce calculation errors and accidental memory modification
- Jokes in code are not appreciated. Use comments for your comedy show.
- No obsceneties, the code is meant to be read by children, even if they are old enough to have encountered these expressions before
